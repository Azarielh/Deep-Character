# Deep-Character

## 📝 Presentation

Deep-Character is a Discord bot designed to help role-players deepen their characters with personalized prompts, sent on demand or automatically at specific times and frequencies. The initial goal was to provide a simple and effective tool to enrich the RP experience, but the project quickly evolved into a mega-bot ambition, integrating many features to energize your worlds and communities.

## 🚀 Main Features

- 🧠 **Development Prompts**: Get ideas to enrich your character, either on command or automatically according to a defined schedule.
- 🗂️ **Prompt Management**: Add, edit, list, and soon delete your prompts. Each prompt can have several tags, and the color circle changes according to the tag.
- 🎲 **Dice Roll**: Roll dice for your games directly from Discord.
- ❓ Universe Quiz
- 🌐 Multilingual system (FR/EN)
- 🛡️ Permission management (admin/user)

## 🛠️ Features in Development or Coming Soon

- 🗑️ **Prompt Deletion**: (Next feature to be implemented) As crazy as it sounds, I haven't implemented it yet, but it's coming very soon.
- 🏷️ **Sorting and Filtering**: (In development 🛠️) Display prompts by tag or filter to show only one type of tag.
- 🧩 **Universe Quiz**: Create quizzes about your universe for your players and get a ranking of the most knowledgeable.
- 💰🛒 **Salary and Shop System**: (Coming soon 🚧) Assign income to characters based on their job and manage a shop for RP purchases, simplifying interactions with NPCs.
- 🧑‍🎤 **Character Creation**: (Coming soon 🚧) A dedicated channel between the bot, the player, and the staff to create and format the character sheet, exportable to forums and adaptable to your templates.
- 🌳 **Rankup and Skill Tree**: (In reflection 💡) Progression system activated by admins/mods, adaptable to your universe and formats.
- 🔄 **Forum/Discord Conversion**: (Coming soon 🚧) As a big Discord user, I still love old-school forums for RP. Some players are full forum, others full Discord, and that's a shame. Convert a Discord RP into an HTML template for forums, and vice versa, to bring communities together.
- 📚 **Integration with a wiki platform**
- 🤝 **Alliance/contract management system between players/factions**
- 📊 **RP activity statistics** (number of messages, etc.)
- 🏆 **Player rankings** (broadcast at the discretion of the admin/mod team)
- 🏦 **Lore bank** (useful if no wiki, with role adaptation (who can see what?) and character evolution)
- 📅 **Campaign tracking** (chapters, objectives, progress)
- 📖 **Session history and campaign journal** (shared between GMs and players, linked to the forum if present)
- 📆🎉 **Event and character/player birthday planning**
- ⏰ **Automatic RP event reminders**
- 📆 **Absence planning to facilitate and optimize the scheduling of major quests/events.**
- 📨 **RP reminder for late players** (can be enabled/disabled)
- 🗳️ **Collective voting tools** (with or without countdown)
- 📋 **Vote history and results**
- 👤 **NPC sheet consultation** (member and admin versions to keep secret info)

## 🌟 Ambitions and Philosophy

Deep-Character is not meant to replace GMs or automate game management with AI. It is a tool designed to make GMs’ lives easier, gather character information, highlight what players aspire for their characters, and entertain the community with quizzes and custom tools. Deep-Character does not know your universe, so prompts and quiz questions must be added by you. Deep-Character will always remain free and without paid options.

## 🛠️ Contribution and Customization

The bot is designed to adapt to your worlds and formats. Character sheet templates must include placeholders defined in the bot's guide. The skill tree and progression system will be customizable, but will require some effort on your part for integration.

## ⚠️ Important Note

Deep-Character is a support tool for GMs and players, not a replacement. It aims to enrich the experience, facilitate management, and strengthen the community, while remaining free and open to customization.
